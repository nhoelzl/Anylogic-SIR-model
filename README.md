# Anylogic SIR Model ðŸ“ˆ
EpidemicsModel based on lecture MOS  (FH Hagenberg, 2020, 2. Semester, DSE).  This is a playground to visualise a SIR  model simulation over time (365 days in total).  The parameters are adjustable before running the model. This model shows how agents  change without demographic considerations  and recovered agents are not susceptible  again (No loss of immunisation).  The simulation will stop after it reaches the stated end (for an optimal experience).
